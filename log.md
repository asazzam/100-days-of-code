# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 17, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: Back to basics. I played around with CSS today.

**Thoughts:** I still have a lot to learn, but I had fun working on this CSS ferris wheel.

### Day 2: April 18, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: I completed Day 1 of [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts). I also started working on an Italian restaurant landing page as part of a "landing page a day" sort of project so I can get more comfortable actually building things. _(Thanks for the idea, Shruthi!)_ I used ChatGPT for the ideas and content.

**Thoughts:** Still getting the hang of things, but I'm having fun just playing around and seeing what works.

### Day 3: April 19, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: I completed Day 2 of [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts). Also did some more work on the Italian restaurant landing page, mainly on styling.

**Thoughts:** I'm definitely not a designer. I feel good about my progress so far, though.

### Day 4: April 20, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: I got a late start today, but finally got started on a blog post project for my Udacity course. I mainly worked on figuring out the layout and figuring out how I want to do the CSS since at least 3 imports are required for this project.

**Thoughts:** I'm still not a designer, so the layout part takes me a bit longer than it should. But I'm looking forward to playing around with flexbox and grid because I need more practice.

**Link to work:** None today, the repo is still private.

### Day 5: April 21, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: I forgot to update the log, but I did work on my blog post project.

**Thoughts:** I didn't get to any of the flexbox or grid yet, but I'm looking forward to seeing how that turns out.

**Link to work:** No link, private repo.

### Day 6: April 22, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: I wanted to switch gears and do something with JavaScript today. I made a heart trail animation and an animated typing text effect.

**Thoughts:** I feel so accomplished when I get something to work!

### Day 7: April 23, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: I didn't get much done today, but I at least finished a mini calendar project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Coding everyday really does help with how much I'm retaining, even when I am only able to work on one small project. I definitely want to keep this habit up.

### Day 8: April 24, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: Another late start day, but I wanted to at least get something completed. I set up the shell of my portfolio site for SkillCrush and completed a rainbow ripple effect on a button.

**Thoughts:** I love seeing what JavaScript is capable of. I can't wait until I understand it more.

### Day 9: April 25, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: It's been a busy week, so I haven't gotten as much done as I would have liked. Today I made a random image generator using Lorem Picsum.

**Thoughts:** I'm hoping I'll get more done this weekend. Progress has been a bit slow the last few days.

### Days 10 - 12: April 26/27/28, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: The busy week turned into busy weekend. Luckily I didn't miss out on any coding, but I did forget to push my commits one day and forgot to update this log. I spent a lot of time working on [practice projects](https://youtu.be/NfvtQ2p5QG4?si=uUc95pgWzDMV5w60), which have been really good for my comprehension. I also worked on my blog post project that's due soon.

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to better understand how things work and am feeling a little more confident in my coding.

### Day 13: April 29, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: Still busy! Didn't have time for much today, but I did do one of the practice projects.

**Thoughts:** I enjoy JavaScript, I just can't wait until I understand it more.

### Day 14: April 30, 2024

#####

**Thoughts:** I'm hoping for more progress tomorrow.

### Day 16: May 2, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my blog post project. I think my practice projects are starting to pay off because it was a lot easier for me to get my layout to be responsive.

**Thoughts:** I was able to work a bit longer today, which was nice. But I only worked on the one project.

**Link to work:** No link today

### Day 17: May 3, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: I worked more on the blog post project. I had some trouble with adding a sidebar, but it's mostly finished. Hopefully I can work it out tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** My goal is to finish this project tomorrow and move on to the next!

**Link to work:** No link today

### Day 18: May 4, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: I started my blog project from scratch and rebuilt the whole thing. I spent a lot of time looking things up and getting rationale from ChatGPT. It went pretty well.

**Thoughts:** I didn't finish it like I had hoped to, but I got really close! I'll finish it tomorrow for sure. I learned a lot more about using grid and flexbox together and definitely have a better understanding.

### Day 19: May 5, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: I made a lot of progress on my blog project, but did not have time to finish it. Mostly because I got ambitious and started adding things at the last minute.

**Thoughts:** I don't love using grid, but I might when I get more used to it.

### Day 20: May 6, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: I finally finished my blog project! I kept breaking things and having to fix them, but it was a good learning experience. I'm not overly proud of the final project, but I'm happy I got there.

**Thoughts:** I'm so excited to move on to something new.
