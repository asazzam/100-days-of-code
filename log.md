# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 17, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: Back to basics. I played around with CSS today.

**Thoughts:** I still have a lot to learn, but I had fun working on this CSS ferris wheel.

### Day 2: April 18, 2024

#####

**Today's Progress**: I completed Day 1 of [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts). I also started working on an Italian restaurant landing page as part of a "landing page a day" sort of project so I can get more comfortable actually building things. _(Thanks for the idea, Shruthi!)_ I used ChatGPT for the ideas and content.

**Thoughts:** Still getting the hang of things, but I'm having fun just playing around and seeing what works.
